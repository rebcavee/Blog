Hello again! Now, we'll address the time series plot. It's similar to a scatter plot, but the points are connected by a line, and the x axis displays time. Let's make sure we have our packages loaded and ready to go:

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

Let's say we want to see how the average MLB salary has changed throughout the years.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID,avg(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY yearID"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

Now that we have the data we need, let's plot it with our trusty ggplot function:

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=avg_salary))+
  xlab('year')
ylab('salary')
```
