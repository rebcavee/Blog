<p>Hello world,</p>
<p>I’m in my last year living the bunhead life at Mercyhurst University—while this makes me an expert at surviving 12-hour school days on Clif bars and prayers alone, I have a lot to learn before I graduate. The material you encounter in this blog will primarily consist of my efforts to learn by teaching.</p>
<p>To engage with my journey to unleashing the full extent of my data visualization superpowers, you’ll need the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>RStudio, with the Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2 packages loaded</li>
<li>Some patience</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for visiting. Feel free to check out my social media while you’re here. There’s exciting content coming soon.</p>
