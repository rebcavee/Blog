Hello world,

I'm in my last year living the bunhead life at Mercyhurst Universityâ€”while this makes me an expert at surviving 12-hour school days on Clif bars and prayers alone, I have a lot to learn before I graduate. The material you encounter in this blog will primarily consist of my efforts to learn by teaching. 

To engage with my journey to unleashing the full extent of my data visualization superpowers, you'll need the following:

1. RStudio, with the Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2 packages loaded
2. Some patience

Thanks for visiting. Feel free to check out my social media while you're here. There's exciting content coming soon.
