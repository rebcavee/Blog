Welcome back! Time to make some bar plots. Let's make sure our packages are loaded:

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```


Let's say we want to make a bar plot showing the MLB pitchers who had the most wins. We could find the data we need by doing:

```{r}
query<-"SELECT nameLast,sum(W) AS career_W
FROM Master INNER JOIN Pitching
ON Master.playerID=Pitching.playerID
GROUP BY Master.playerID
HAVING sum(W)>370"
result<-sqldf(query)
result$nameLast<-factor(result$nameLast, levels=result$nameLast)
```

Now, let's visualize our data with ggplot2:

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=result,aes(x=nameLast,y=career_W), stat='identity')
```
